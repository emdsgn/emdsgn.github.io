      <h1>GiraffeBaby</h1>
      <p class="body">GiraffeBaby<sup>TM</sup> is a baby brand for innovative product made up of PLA .When we started families of our own, we shared a mission: to help parents like us create a baby-safe world. We would do this by creating a world of products made to go wherever babies go. Because exploring and discovering is a baby’s full time job. Our job—every parent’s job— is to make it safe for babies to do theirs. It’s the best way to make sure they fully develop and thrive.</p>

      <p class="body">The goal of this project was to redesign and develop their website. The website was developed through Shopify with a unique template designed by me.</p>
